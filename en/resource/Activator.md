## Network Configuration

The Tuya hardware module supports two network configuration modes, namely, quick connection mode (TLink, it is referred to as the EZ mode) and hotspot mode (AP mode). The quick connection mode features convenient operation. It is recommended to use the hotspot mode as the backup in case the quick connection mode fails. The wired network configuration is used in Zigbee, and no Wifi configuration information needs to be entered. 


All functions related to the network configuration are realized by using the `TuyaSmartActivator` Class (singleton).
